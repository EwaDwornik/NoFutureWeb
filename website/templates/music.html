<h1>Music</h1>
<h7>Music is an another important part of my life.
    I did my BA with Artistic Education in Musical Art, <br>
    I’ve learnt how to play the harmonium in a classical way
    from a great music teacher in India. <br>
    What to say more, music is in my soul,
    in my heart and in my mind all the time.<br>

I’m fully engaged with a project Ʒɛb ənd Iːwa, with my pal Jeb. <br>
    We live on a small island where two tectonic plates meet, <br>
    and it inspired us to connect Eastern, traditional music with Western vibes. <br>
    Jeb’s mellow guitar playing happened to match perfectly with what I learnt in India <br>
    when we tried to play together, so was born the band! .<br>
